# $Data$ $Preparation$


### $Data$ $Integration$
It is the first step and involves integrating data from different sources and incorporating the data into tabular formats if they are not.

### $Data$ $Cleansing$
Process by which the important data of the accessories are discriminated and at the same time the truthful ones of the erroneous ones. Then we proceed to reject or delete those data that will not be used and validate those that will be kept.

### $Data$ $Normalization$
This step identifies the same values with different notations and rewrites them in a uniform manner. 
Example: Calle S Martín, Calle Gral. San Martín, Calle José de San Martín.... = Calle Gral. José de San Martín.

### $Imputation$ $of$ $Missing$ $Values$
The imputation of missing values is related to the identification of cases where there is loss or absence of data. In these cases it will be important to carry out reconstruction actions, although it is not always possible to solve them.

### $Data$ $Transformation$
This is the time when new information will be converted to a database-compatible format. At this point it is critical to reduce the distorting effect of the transformation.

### $Data$ $Modeling$
Relationships between data are established, entities containing master data and which contain facts are determined, giving rise to dimensions and metrics.

### $Reporting$ $and$ $Visualization$
Information is generated from the data, that information is available for analysis, which gives rise to Knowledge.
